## LoadTabOnSelect Evolution

**20180416 Version 1.1**

add : ignoring file:// to respect web extension policy

**20180416 Version 1.0**

Forked from the original https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/loadtabonselect/

#### Description

LoadTabOnSelect prevents new tabs from automatically loading, instead loading them on selection.

The intended usage of the addon is to facilitate power-users who open many tabs before viewing, but dislike auto-playing videos (and other annoyances).

This addon uses the WebExtensions API, and therefore fully supports Firefox 48+ (tested on Firefox ESR).

The only required permission is `tabs`.

## LoadTabOnSelect
**Version 1.2  | September 5 2017**

LoadTabOnSelect prevents new tabs from automatically loading, instead loading them on selection.

The intended usage of the addon is to facilitate power-users who open many tabs before viewing, but dislike auto-playing videos (and other annoyances).

This addon uses the WebExtensions API, and therefore fully supports Firefox 57+.

The only required permission is `tabs`.
